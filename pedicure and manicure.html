        Top Health Benefits of Regular Manicures and Pedicures.
        <br><br> 
More often than not, manicures and pedicures fall into the category of ‘pampering.’ Although it is certainly enjoyable to have your nails done, there are some excellent reasons why this should be more than just the occasional luxury experience. 

In fact, there are a number of health benefits to regularly investing in manicures and pedicures that go far beyond just aesthetics. This includes: 

<br><br>
1. Prevents infections.
If you don’t moisturize your skin on a regular basis, the dry skin on your feet is more prone to infection due to cracks that may form. Additionally, the clipping, cleaning, and cutting of your toenails that take place during a pedicure will prevent your nails from growing inwards and causing an infection.

<br>
2. Promotes healthy blood circulation.
During a manicure and pedicure, you will receive a massage on your arms, lower legs, and feet. This will promote healthy blood circulation, reducing muscle tension, any pain you may be experiencing, and improving joint mobility.

<br>
3. Boosted nail health.
With regular manicures/pedicures, the chances of your nails developing fungi and other infections are reduced. Also, the exfoliation that takes place during this appointment will remove any dead skin cells and encourage new cell growth, leaving your nails stronger and healthier.

<br>
4. Reduction in back pain.
You may be familiar with the calluses that form on the soles of your feet. Besides being frustrating and painful, these can also affect your body weight distribution and cause back pain. During a pedicure, your technician can exfoliate and deep clean your feet to prevent calluses and help eliminate any pain you may have.

<br>
5. It can make your hands and feet look younger.
Manicures and pedicures improve blood flow, which is important in reducing cellulite, tightening your skin, and strengthening your muscles — all of which can improve the visible appearance of your hands and feet.

<br>
6. Improved mental health.
Whether it’s a particularly stressful day or a hectic week, taking the time to treat yourself with a manicure/pedicure can do wonders for your stress levels! The massage, relaxing experience, and pampering will free your mind from any tension, boosting your mental health.
