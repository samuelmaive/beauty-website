        <h2><u>Indian Head Massage</u></h2>
        <p class="text-justify">It sounds like a treat for a special occasion or spa break, but actually Indian Head Massage has many health benefits both physically and emotionally.

          The aim of Indian head massage is to release tension in the muscles and joints of the head, face, neck and shoulders. Indian head massage can also help with relieving fatigue, insomnia, headaches, and sinusitis. The experience is deeply calming and relaxing, leaving a feeling of increased energy, concentration and revitalisation.
          
          Take a look at 7 benefits below and treat yourself to an Indian head massage today!
          <br>
          
          1.Aids in the relief of migraines
          Often tension in the mid back, neck and head can lead to headaches and migraines. Your massage will focus on applying pressure to the mid back, arms and shoulders to reduce tension in the muscles. Massage around the neck and head encourages circulation of cerebral fluid and reduce headache causing blockages.
          <br>
          
          2.Promotes Hair Growth
          Massage to the scalp and head increases nourishment and oxygen to the hair follicle which in turn stimulates hair growth. Kneading of the head during a massage, opens up the blood vessels on the scalp and helps in better absorption by the blood vessels . Each hair follicle needs equal amount of nutrients to go into them for the proper growth of each of the strands. Therefore the more massage you have (also accompanied by a good shampoo), the greater the chances of good hair growth.
          <br>
          
          3.Stimulates Lymphatic Drainage
          The lymphatic system removes waste products from the tissues and back to the heart. Indian head massage aids in this process by stimulating circulation, encouraging the natural drainage of the lymph. It also helps in bringing new nutrients and oxygen to cells. Indian head massage when used for lymphatic drainage can be used to treat swelling and post-traumatic facial oedema after bruising, fracture or surgical procedure.
          <br>
          
          4.Relieves insomnia and fatigue
          Indian head massage relieves stress and tension within the body by promoting relaxation. This allows a deep sense of well being and relaxation, which in turn affects your sleep cycle.
          <br>
          
          5.Relieves symptoms of anxiety and depression
          Massaging the head encourages the supply of oxygen to the brain which is one of the best ways of reducing anxiety and of lifting one’s mood. Oxygen helps you think clearly and creatively and a similar effect is experienced through exercise.
          <br>
          
          6.Renews energy levels
          An Indian Head Massage works with the Ayurvedic concept which goes beyond the limits of healing and places emphasis on balance. Working on the chakras through Indian Massage has a powerful effect in bringing the energy of the body back into balance.
          <br>
          
          7.Boost memory capabilities
          Often we have short-term memory difficulties because our brains are overloaded with disorganised thoughts, making it very difficult for us to efficiently ‘log’ and collect thoughts and occurrences. Indian Head Massage slows us down, sensual awareness takes over, thoughts quieten and awareness is brought to the forefront.
